#Safety Helmet Dataset
This data set is in Pascal VOC format, and there are two categories: people wearing helmets (hat) and people without helmets (person).
Collect the existing data sets and network images, partially screen the images, and take a few construction images offline to make the data sets more specific.
On the basis of SafetyHelmetWearing-Dataset, the suffix of images in JPEGImages file is unified into lowercase jpg,
the missing and incoherent serial numbers in the data set are filled, and some helmet images are supplemented.
